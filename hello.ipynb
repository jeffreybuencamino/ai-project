      "On July 11, 2025, President Trump visited Kerr County, Texas, the site of a catastrophic flash flood that claimed at least 120 lives on July 4. He defended the federal and state disaster response efforts, praising Texas Governor Greg Abbott and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem. Critics have raised concerns about the lack of early warning systems and federal budget cuts that may have exacerbated the disaster's impact.

      "President Trump has reignited trade tensions by threatening new tariffs ranging from 25% to 50% on imports from nearly two dozen countries, including South Korea, Japan, Canada, Bangladesh, and Brazil, unless they agree to bilateral trade deals. These measures, set to begin in August 2025, have caused significant uncertainty for businesses, with analysts predicting a rise in consumer prices, particularly for clothing and footwear.
